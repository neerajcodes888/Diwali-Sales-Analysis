## Introduction

The Sales Analysis Python project is built to streamline the process of analyzing sales data. It leverages the power of Python and various data analysis libraries to perform data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. This project serves as a foundation that can be extended and customized to suit specific business needs.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Easily import sales data from various sources such as CSV, Excel, or databases.
- **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Data Exploration:** Explore the data to understand its structure, features, and basic statistics.
- **Sales Metrics:** Calculate key sales metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and more.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Analyze sales trends and patterns over time to identify seasonal or long-term trends.
- **Product Analysis:** Gain insights into product performance by analyzing sales by product category, type, or SKU.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Visualize sales geographically using maps to understand regional distribution.
- **Visualization:** Create various charts, graphs, and plots to visualize sales data and insights.
- **Reporting:** Generate detailed reports summarizing the sales analysis results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/neerajcodes/Sales-Analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Sales-Analysis`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare your sales data in a suitable format (CSV, Excel, etc.).
2. Place the data file in the project directory or specify its path in the code.
3. Open the `main.py` script and configure settings such as data file paths, analysis options, etc.
4. Run the `main.py` script using the command: `python main.py`
5. View the generated charts, graphs, and analysis results in the output or saved files.

## Data

The project expects sales data in a structured format, including columns like:
- Date
- Product ID or Name
- Quantity Sold
- Price per Unit
- Customer Information

Ensure your data matches this structure or make necessary modifications in the code.

## Analysis

The analysis involves several steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Basic data exploration and summary statistics
3. Calculation of key sales metrics
4. Time series analysis to identify trends and patterns
5. Product-specific analysis to understand performance
6. Geographical analysis for regional insights

## Visualization

Visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the data. The project uses libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various types of charts, including line charts, bar plots, scatter plots, and more.
